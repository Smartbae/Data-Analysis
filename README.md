# Sale Data-Analysis

### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of two companies (Computech and Microworld) for a given period of time (Jan 2023 - June 2023). By analysing various aspects of the sales data, we seek to identify trends, sales data-driven recommendation, and gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance.

### Data Source

### Tool

- Excel [Download here](https://microsoft.com)
  
### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to identify key informations, such as:

- Sales by month
- Sales by manager
- Sales by store
- Sales by categories

### Results/Findings

The result analysis was summarised as follows:
1. Computech made more sales than Microworld.
2. Spencer Lee (Manager) made the most sales.
3. Product Category:
   - PC is the best category for Computech while TV is the least.
   - Memory card is the best category for Microworld while games is the least.
4. The most sale was made by Microworld in the month of April.

### Recommendation

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
 - Informations should be sourced from customers on how they feel about our services and products by giving them questionaires to state their feelings.
 - Managers in Microworld should ensure that the employees are well treated and cared for.
 - internal check should be made to ensure that employees treat customers right (hint: A scenario of a checkpersonnel disguised as a customer could be applied).
 - Proper training should be given to employees on how to care for their customers and turn them into returning custormers overtime.
 - Proper check should be made on managers to ensure that they are carrying out their duties properly.
 - The location where Microworld is located should be checked for accessibility, and based on the items sold by our company, are customers around that location technologically exposed? The company can create free skill acquisition for individuals in such locations who will see the relevance of purchasing technological devices.
 - Proper and intense advertisement should be carried out in locations that makes less sales.
 - Spencer Lee, Jason Hervey, and Chris Fletcher made the most sale, therefore, managers from all branches should work closely with them to get ideas and tips on how to do better.
 - Reward should be given to managers, employees and customers who stands out to help boost their performance in the future.
 - The highest sales made by Computech was in the month of April, whatever strategy employed should be implemented always to boost sales in all branches.
 - More supplies should be made on Memory card and Pc to Microworld and Computech respectively while less supplies should be made on TV and games to Computech and Microworld respectively.
 - Advice should be seeked from employees, managers and customers on how the company can better serve their customer and grow for the benefit of everyone.
